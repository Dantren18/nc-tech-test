Please add any additional notes hereâ€¦

Regarding the 2nd endpoint, to return a single card entry, it says on the readme as an example the response should look like so:

"availableSizes": [
{
"id": "sm",
"title": "Small"
},
{
"id": "md",
"title": "Medium"
},
{
"id": "gt",
"title": "Giant"
}
],

I was unsure on this part, because in all of the JSON files the size is just specified as 'sm', 'md', without the full word equivalent mentioned anywhere.

I have assumed in the sizes.json file there should be some data to use for this task, but that file appears to be the same as cards.json. So I have just left the sizes data as it is when being extrated from cards.json. Just wanted to mention to let you know I considered it, and in a real work situation would have seeked clarification
