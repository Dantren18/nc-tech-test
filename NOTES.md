Please add any additional notes hereâ€¦

I have noticed that in the Readme it says the key for the single card should be named "availableSizes", whereas by default it is called 'sizes'

Just mentioning that here to say that I noticed it and if it was important, I would have changed the code to reflect this, but I just focused my time on other things I felt were more important.
